\begin{abstract}
  Every year experts attempt to determine which basketball players are the most
  valuable and when those players should be picked in the NBA draft. In this
  paper, we record our efforts to accurately predict where players should be
  drafted based on their stats using different machine learning models. We first
  describe by what means our data was gathered and what type of data we
  gathered. We then review the results we had in predicting a player’s draft
  position with our different models, namely KNN, decision tree, multi-layer
  perceptron, and linear regression. We then review our findings, especially
  from linear regression, in summarizing which statistics were important, and
  which were not as important. Lastly our ideas for future work and improvements
  to our research are made known.

\section{Introduction}

NBA scouts are always looking for NBA potential players. When determining how
good a player is they are almost always compared to past players. Most people
are able to predict the top 3 to 5 NBA picks from the available players but it
is nigh impossible to predict each draft pick accurately. 

In our research we attempted to use machine learning models to predict where a
player would be drafted. These models use the past 11 years of NBA draft
results, along with the players’ associated statistics, to determine where the
player should be drafted if they are to be drafted at all.

There was some difficulty in predicting a player’s draft position as it is a
human perception of that player’s capability and is often swayed by what each
NBA teams’ current needs are. We were also limited to a certain number of
players as the era of basketball has changed, encouraging more long range field
goals compared to years prior. This drastically affects the typical stats for
players making comparisons between newer and older players less viable.

Despite those difficulties we were able to predict a player’s draft position to
within 10 picks. In a future study if we were to account for the aforementioned
issues the accuracy of our results could be increased.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data Source}

There are various online providers of basketball statistics. Official sources
include NBA.com and the official site of NCAA basketball. However, official
sources often do not include more than the most basic statistics.

Several sites exist that provide extensive college statistics. Many of these
have a paywall (kenpom.com) or do not include statistics for international
prospects. Other sites request not to be scraped by bots.

After further exploration, we found realgm.com, a site that consented to limited
scraping that also included historical data for past statistics, data on
international prospects, and a wide array of advanced statistics. We wrote a web
scraper in Python to traverse the element tree of the web page and lift each of
the players selected in the past 11 NBA drafts and every available statistics
associated with those 660 players. This formed our initial dataset, which was
stored in a CSV file. We also pulled the records of nearly 736 prospects that
went undrafted during that same time period. 

\subsection{Featurization of Data}

Due to the nature of basketball statistics, the data scraped from the website
was already largely in the form we needed. We wrote a Python script to perform a
few sanitizing steps and convert the CSV file to an ARFF file.

The main sanitization we needed to perform was the consolidation of various
leagues that prospects played in. Prospects played in over 35 leagues and
countries. While there was consistency for prospects that played in the NCAA in
the United States, there was extreme fragmentation among the teams and leagues
that international prospects played for. In order to help the model, we grouped
all international teams under one label, leaving us with three total league
labels: NCAA, G-League, and International.

While drafted players were labeled according to their draft selection, the
undrafted players that we pulled were unlabeled. We didn’t want to use a
clustering algorithm to label these instances - a clustering algorithm would
attempt to label these players with a pick number from 1 to 60, whereas we
wanted to be able to predict if a player went undrafted. We decided to label any
undrafted player as being picked 61st, with the plan of interpreting our future
model’s output under this assumption. This led to over half of our dataset
consisting of players “selecting 61st in the draft”. This would prove to have
some positive effects, such as giving the model many examples of poor prospects
on the higher end of the draft. It would also have negative effects, such as
leading the models to be biased towards higher pick numbers when it was unsure. 

\subsection{Models}

We used a variety of models in this project, to be described in further detail
in results sections. All implementations came from scikit learn v1.0.1.

\section{Initial Results}

Initially, we trained Decision Tree, Multi-Layer Perceptron, KNN-Neighbor, and
Linear Regression models. Each of these had a grid of hyperparameters that was
exhaustively searched to find the best results, as recorded in Table
\ref{tab:test_table}.
